Helllo world. GitHub guides.

I am learning to use Github.

Now I know that I can create many repositories. A repository seems like a project when you start a new coding.

There are many branches in a repository. The default one is the master branch. When I want to make changes to a repository, I should firltly create a new branch and make changes on the new branch. Those changes are called commits. Then, maybe after more users check the commits, or they come to a stable stage, I can synchronize the commits, or to say, merge the new branch to the master branch.
